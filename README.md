This workshop shows you how, using AWS, you can parallelise the training of your reinforcement learning algorithms to get insanely fast turn around times & results for your reinforcement learning experiments.

# Instructions

## Step 1 - Login to Sagemaker

&nbsp;

1. Login to AWS Console
2. Click "Find Services"
3. Type "SageMaker" and hit enter




## Step 2 - open our Notebook instance

&nbsp;


1. On the left menu under the "Notebook" section, click "Notebook instances"

&nbsp;


Please note that in some rare cases the Jupyter notebook may give you a pop up asking which kernel to use. If this happens to you please select **"conda_tensorflow_p36"** as the kernel of choice.

&nbsp;

The rest of the workshop continues in the Jupyter notebook. Follow the instructions there to continue to learn about distributed Reinforcement Learning with Sagemaker RL.
